# Serena MCP Docs

- Primary reference: `overview.md` â€” captures launch commands, environment variables, and validation steps for the Serena MCP server.
- Keep this folder aligned with `.mcp/AGENTS.md`, `.mcp/.env.mcp.example`, and MCPSAG guidance whenever Serena defaults or tooling change.
- Update `overview.md` with upstream sync dates and refresh this README if new supporting files (e.g., examples, troubleshooting notes) are added.
