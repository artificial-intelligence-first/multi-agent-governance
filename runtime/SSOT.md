# SSOT â€” /runtime

## Canonical References
- Repository baseline: /SSOT.md (root).
- Flow orchestration details: runtime/AGENTS.md and PLANS.md entries for current workflows.

## Notes
- Capture any repository-wide decisions about log retention, `telemetry/runs/` structure, or Flow Runner configuration here.
- Ensure changes remain in sync with /SSOT.md so downstream agents trust runtime assets.
