# Repository File Governance

Centralise policies for canonical repo artefacts here (AGENTS, PLANS, SSOT, CHANGELOG, PNPM, etc.).

- Keep each topic in its own Markdown file following `docs/reference/reference-template.md`, with `last synced` metadata and an Update Log.
- Emphasise required sections, naming rules, and review cadences so agents updating these artefacts follow the same conventions.
- Revalidate at least every 60 days or when upstream governance specs (OpenAI, MCP, or internal SOPs) evolve to avoid drift between references and automation.
