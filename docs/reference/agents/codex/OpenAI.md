# OpenAI Codex Platform Overview

## Summary
- Collects official Codex resources—GitHub repository, CLI, IDE integrations, cloud platform, and SDK—into one reference so Multi Agent Governance teams can adopt Codex consistently.
- Focuses on setup, authentication, context handling, and operational guardrails that must stay in sync with this repository’s AGENTS policies.

## Key Details
- **GitHub repository**
  - Review the README for high-level architecture, licensing, and supported use cases.
  - Monitor releases and tags for updates to Codex tooling, example projects, or migration notices.
  - Check issues/discussions for roadmap signals, deprecation timelines, and best practices shared by the Codex team.
- **Codex CLI**
  - Official docs cover installation prerequisites, authentication (API keys, profiles), and commands such as running edits, streaming completions, or uploading context files.
  - Supports passing repository metadata (including AGENTS.md excerpts) so Codex follows project-specific rules during scripted sessions.
  - Designed for scripted automation; align usage with Multi Agent Governance shell guardrails (`apply_patch`, non-destructive commands, mandatory test execution).
- **IDE extensions**
  - Provide inline code assistance (completion, refactoring, explanation) within IDEs like VS Code or JetBrains.
  - Configuration pages describe permission scopes, telemetry options, and organization-level controls; verify these before enabling in shared repos.
  - Map AGENTS requirements (style, lint, testing) into the extension settings or prompt templates so Codex-generated suggestions stay compliant.
- **Codex Cloud**
  - Managed environment for hosting Codex workloads with dashboards for quotas, latency, and cost controls.
  - Documentation outlines environment provisioning, secret management, audit logging, and safety features (e.g., allowlists, moderation).
  - Coordinate with Multi Agent Governance ops to ensure cloud projects mirror the same observability and rollback expectations defined in AGENTS/SSOT.
- **Codex SDK**
  - Language-specific client libraries (e.g., JavaScript, Python) for embedding Codex into automation flows.
  - Pay attention to versioning, authentication patterns, streaming APIs, and rate-limit handling before wiring into `src/automation/` scripts.
  - SDK samples often show how to combine prompts, context files, and testing hooks—capture the relevant patterns when adopting them here.

## Dependencies
- Any Codex workflow must obey the root `AGENTS.md` guardrails: always run tests before merge, avoid destructive shell operations, log key actions, and persist docs when needed.
- Update automation scripts and DocsSAG outputs when CLI/IDE/SDK behaviours change so AI agents and humans rely on the same instructions.
- Store API keys or cloud credentials outside the repo; reference their existence (not values) in AGENTS updates or ops runbooks.

## Update Log
- 2025-10-13: Consolidated Codex GitHub, CLI, IDE, Cloud, and SDK resources into a single overview.
