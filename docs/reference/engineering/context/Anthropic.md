# Anthropic – Effective Context Engineering for AI Agents

## Summary
- Describes Anthropic’s recommended lifecycle for supplying high-quality context to autonomous agents.
- Emphasises evaluation loops, safety guardrails, and telemetry to keep long-lived agents reliable.
- Incorporates Claude Docs long-context examples that show how to bundle multi-document prompts for large context windows.

## Key Details
- Context pipelines should separate retrieval, filtering, and formatting stages; each stage receives targeted instrumentation.
- Anthropic identifies four context pillars—relevance, recency, reliability, and responsibility—and suggests metrics for each.
- Encourages maintaining a test suite that replays representative tasks to catch regressions when context policies change.
- Stresses annotating retrieved artefacts with provenance metadata (source, timestamp, trust tier) that downstream prompts can cite.
- Recommends progressive disclosure: start with a minimal core context, request clarifications from users, and only then expand to large knowledge drops.
- Claude multi-document guidance advises placing priority documents early, tagging sections with consistent headers/delimiters, summarising supporting evidence before full text, and finishing with explicit task instructions referencing the supplied sections.

## Dependencies
- Complements DAIR.AI context-engineering workflow for stepwise experimentation and tooling.
- Works with Multi Agent Governance retrieval helpers that pre-format knowledge cards before insertion into Claude-style bundles.
