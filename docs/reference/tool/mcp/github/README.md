# GitHub MCP Materials

Keep GitHub MCP server documentation here (connection details, scopes, rate limits, and workflow integration tips).

- Ensure each Markdown entry cites upstream references with `last synced` dates and maintains an Update Log per the repository template.
- Document both REST and GraphQL usage patterns so `.mcp/.mcp-config.yaml`, MCPSAG checklists, and Flow Runner workflows share the same expectations.
- Capture security-specific capabilities in `security.md` so SecuritySAG can align SOPs, prompts, and telemetry with GitHub guidance.
- Validate quarterly or whenever GitHub updates API versions, authentication requirements, security tooling, or MCP capabilities.
