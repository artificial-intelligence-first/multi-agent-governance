# Agent SDK References

Use this directory to document SDKs that power agent execution (OpenAI Agents SDK, Codex SDK, etc.).

- Each SDK subfolder should host language- or product-specific notes derived from `docs/reference/reference-template.md`.
- Highlight installation commands, capability coverage, and version caveats, citing upstream sources with `last synced` metadata.
- Revisit the content whenever SDK releases introduce new APIs or transport options; aim for a 45-day review cadence at minimum.
