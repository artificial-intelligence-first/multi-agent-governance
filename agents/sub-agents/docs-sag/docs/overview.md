# DocsSAG Overview

DocsSAG is the documentation drafting sub-agent for the Multi Agent System. It consumes curated knowledge packets, outlines, and constraints to produce publication-ready Markdown drafts tailored to the specified audience. KnowledgeMag ensures the content is accurate and governed; DocsSAG turns that knowledge into narrative artifacts ready for editors.

## Capabilities
- Expands KnowledgeMag cards into cohesive Markdown sections with clear headings, summaries, and actionable bullet points.
- Flags missing details, citation mismatches, or absent operational steps in review notes.
- Preserves knowledge source identifiers and SSOT terminology throughout the draft.
- Emits diagnostics under the `docs_sag.*` namespace so observability dashboards can track drafting throughput and coverage.

## Handoffs
- **Inbound:** Requests conforming to `agents/contracts/docs_sag_request.schema.json`, typically generated by KnowledgeMag or editorial tooling.
- **Outbound:** Responses shaped by `agents/contracts/docs_sag_response.schema.json` containing Markdown drafts, structured sections, review notes, and follow-up questions.

## Routing
- Primary route key: `documentation` (see `agents/AGENT_REGISTRY.yaml`).
- Backup handler: manual documentation squad takes over if DocsSAG is degraded.

## Lifecycle
1. Validate incoming payloads against the DocsSAG request schema.
2. Load shared documentation guardrails plus any tone or policy constraints from the request.
3. Generate Markdown content, build structured section metadata, and collate review notes.
4. Execute `workflows/draft_docs.wf.yaml` to validate schema compliance and terminology alignment.
5. Publish diagnostics and logs for observability and post-run analytics.
