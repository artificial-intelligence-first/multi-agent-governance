# Tooling References

Use this directory to track external tools and integrations consumed by the agent fleet (for example MCP servers, SDK CLIs, or routing helpers).

- Organise material under a subfolder per tool family (`mcp/`, etc.) and base every entry on `docs/reference/reference-template.md`.
- Document installation paths, configuration expectations, rate limits, and troubleshooting notes with `last synced` updates.
- Review on a 45-day cadence or immediately when tool vendors ship breaking changes so `.mcp/.mcp-config.yaml` and automation scripts stay consistent.
