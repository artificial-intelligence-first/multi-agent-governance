# Agent Kit Overview

## Purpose
- Summarise officially supported agent starter kits and scaffolding patterns so fleet builders can bootstrap new automation quickly.
- Capture release cadence, sample projects, and extension points for each vendor kit.

## Contents
- [OpenAI Agent Kit](OpenAI.md) — covers installation, scaffolding commands, and deployment targets.

## Maintenance
- Sync with upstream release notes after major version bumps or new template launches.
- Record refreshes in each per-source document’s Update Log and alert MCPSAG if routing defaults or SDK dependencies shift.
