# SecuritySAG Workflows

- Reserve this directory for Flow Runner automations that orchestrate GitHub MCP security sweeps.
- Coordinate workflow additions with WorkflowMAG and MCPSAG so telemetry and routing stay aligned.
- When adding a flow, include validation commands and update `agents/AGENT_REGISTRY.yaml` with new SOP or workflow prerequisites.
