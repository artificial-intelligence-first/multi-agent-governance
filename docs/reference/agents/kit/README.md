# Agent Kit References

Collect guidance for agent starter kits and scaffolding here (currently OpenAIâ€™s Agent Kit under `agent-kit/`).

- Mirror the structure from `docs/reference/reference-template.md` for every Markdown entry.
- Track new releases, breaking changes, and sample project updates with `last synced` dates plus Update Log bullets.
- Revalidate quarterly or whenever upstream kit tooling evolves so DocsSAG and PromptSAG stay aligned with the latest scaffolds.
