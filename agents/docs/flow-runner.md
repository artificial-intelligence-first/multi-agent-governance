# Flow Runner Integration

WorkFlowMAG orchestrates Multi Agent Governance workflows using [flow-runner](https://github.com/artificial-intelligence-first/flow-runner). Vendored packages live in `src/flowrunner/` and `src/mcprouter/`, and `make setup-flow-runner` installs them into the Python user site so `flowctl` is available.

## Bootstrap

```bash
make setup-flow-runner
```

The helper script (`src/automation/scripts/setup_flow_runner.sh`) ensures the vendored packages are up to date. Add the user-site bin directory (`python -m site --user-base`) to your `PATH` so `flowctl` resolves; use `uvx mcpctl` for MCP router smoke tests.

MCP routing now reads from `.mcp/.mcp-config.yaml`. Copy `.mcp/.env.mcp.example` to `.mcp/.env.mcp`, provide real tokens, and keep the file untracked so every tool (Codex, Cursor, Flow Runner) shares the same configuration.
- Enabling the GitHub provider requires `GITHUB_TOKEN`; once set, Flow Runner MCP steps can call GitHub REST or GraphQL endpoints directly through the shared router (`config.graphql: true` sends GraphQL queries with optional `variables`).

## Running WorkFlowMAG flows

The primary orchestration flow is `runtime/automation/flow_runner/flows/workflow_mag.flow.yaml`. It models parallel execution by letting the Docs and Prompts stages start immediately after the Plan stage. Context follows Prompts, QA waits on Docs and Context, Operations reviews QA output, and Finalize closes the run.

```bash
flowctl run runtime/automation/flow_runner/flows/workflow_mag.flow.yaml --dry-run
```

`--dry-run` prints the resolved execution order without invoking external agents. Real runs emit artifacts under `.runs/<RUN_ID>/` and produce English-language deliverables for consistent auditing.

## Extending flows

- Add or modify stages by editing `workflow_mag.flow.yaml` and, if needed, implementing new stubs in `src/flow_runner/tasks/workflow_mag/`.
- Keep `agent_paths` aligned with available packages; remove unused entries to avoid stale imports.
- Update parallelization logic carefullyâ€”ensure stage dependencies reflect the actual data flow so Flow Runner can execute safely.

## Validation

Use `make validate`, `make test`, and `flowctl run --dry-run runtime/automation/flow_runner/flows/workflow_mag.flow.yaml` to confirm contracts, tests, and the orchestration graph stay healthy after changes.
