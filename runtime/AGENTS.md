# AGENTS â€” /runtime

## Role
- Host Flow Runner configuration, execution assets, and generated artifacts for the Multi Agent Governance repository.
- Provide a stable workspace for `.runs/` outputs and automation logs referenced throughout the governance playbook.

## Responsibilities
- Follow guidance from `/AGENTS.md` and `/SSOT.md`, along with runtime-specific notes maintained in PLANS.md or the relevant workflow documentation.
- Maintain directory conventions (`runtime/automation/...`, `.runs/<run_id>`) so scripts and agents can stream artifacts reliably.
- When structure or policy changes, document it in PLANS.md or the associated workflow log for traceability.

## Points of Contact
- WorkFlowMAG (Flow Runner orchestration)  
- OperationsMAG (observability and telemetry governance)
