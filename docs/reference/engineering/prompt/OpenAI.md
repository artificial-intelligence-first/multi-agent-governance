# GPT-5 Codex Prompting Reference

## Summary
- Consolidates the OpenAI Codex Prompting Guide and the GPT-5 Codex Cookbook notes so the Multi Agent System follows the official best practices for AI-assisted code work.
- Emphasises concise, high-signal instructions that surface the right code context, verification commands, and safety guardrails for GPT-5 Codex.

## Key Details
- **Point Codex to concrete code**: Name the files, modules, stack traces, or identifiers that matter, and paste the relevant snippets when possible so Codex avoids broad searches.
- **State verification upfront**: Spell out the exact commands (`pytest ...`, `pnpm test`, etc.), repro steps, and prerequisites so Codex understands how success is measured.
- **Declare constraints early**: List allowed/disallowed files, tool availability, formatting rules, and safety guardrails (e.g., “no destructive shell commands”) at the start.
- **Break work into steps**: Ask Codex to plan and execute in small chunks—plan → implement → test—so validation and rollback stay manageable.
- **Use logs and traces directly**: Paste full logs, stack traces, or failing command output so Codex can reason through hypotheses instead of guessing.
- **Mix in exploratory prompts**: Occasionally request cleanup, refactoring ideas, or doc improvements to capture extra value beyond the main change.
- **Keep prompts tight**: GPT-5 Codex responds best to short instructions; excessive boilerplate or preambles can degrade quality.
- **Avoid forced prefixes**: GPT-5 Codex does not support prefaces; forcing them may truncate output. Let the model start the solution immediately.
- **Limit tools**: Expose only required tools (terminal, `apply_patch`, etc.) with brief descriptions to reduce misfires.
- **Tune reasoning sparingly**: Default reasoning is fast; raise it only when problems are complex so interactive sessions remain responsive.

## Dependencies
- Reinforce the guardrails defined in the root `AGENTS.md` (testing before PRs, safe shell commands, logging expectations).
- Keep documentation generated by DocsSAG aligned with these prompting rules so human guidance and AI automation stay consistent.
- Update this note whenever OpenAI revises Codex prompting guidance, especially around tool usage or reasoning modes.

## Update Log
- 2025-10-13: Initial capture based on OpenAI Codex Prompting Guide and GPT-5 Codex Cookbook example.
