# MCP SDK Materials

Use this directory for language-specific MCP SDK notes (currently Python and TypeScript) that complement protocol-level guidance.

- Derive every Markdown document from `docs/reference/reference-template.md` and log refreshes with `last synced` metadata plus Update Log entries.
- Highlight installation commands, sample code, transport helpers, and compatibility caveats so automation remains portable across runtimes.
- Revisit documentation with each SDK release or at least every 60 days to track API changes and new helper utilities.
