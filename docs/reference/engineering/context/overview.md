# Context Engineering Overview

## Purpose
- Summarise leading practices for designing, retrieving, and evaluating context bundles that feed LLM workflows.
- Bridge vendor-specific recommendations with independent research so agents can tailor context strategies per task.

## Contents
- [Anthropic context guidance](Anthropic.md) — covers retrieval APIs, chunking, and Claude-specific limits.
- [DAIR.AI context engineering guide](DAIR.AI.md) — provides a vendor-agnostic framework for context collection, evaluation, and rollout.

## Maintenance
- Revisit whenever Anthropic updates Claude context limits or DAIR.AI revises its playbooks.
- Ensure Update Logs within each per-source file capture refreshes and feed outcomes to DocsSAG or KnowledgeMag when automation changes.
