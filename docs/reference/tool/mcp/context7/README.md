# Context7 MCP Materials

This folder stores Context7-specific MCP references such as `overview.md`, installation snippets, and governance notes.

- Align updates with `docs/reference/reference-template.md`; record source URLs and `last synced` metadata in every Markdown file.
- Capture API key handling, transport options, and client-specific configuration so `.mcp/AGENTS.md` and MCPSAG stay in sync with live settings.
- Re-check after Context7 releases new transports, rate limits, or editor integrationsâ€”aim for a 45-day validation cycle.
