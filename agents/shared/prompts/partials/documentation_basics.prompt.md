## Documentation Guardrails
- Use concise, action-oriented headings and keep Markdown hierarchy consistent.
- Summarise each section in one to two sentences before listing key actions or bullets.
- Highlight gaps (missing data, unresolved owners, absent rollback steps) in `review_notes` and `follow_up_questions`.
- Preserve product names, routes, and metrics exactly as provided unless SSOT overrides them.
- Keep tone operational and avoid speculative language unless the request explicitly calls for brainstorming.
