# AGENTS â€” /scripts

## Role
- Provide shared automation and maintenance scripts for the Multi Agent System repository.
- Support Flow Runner setup, validation helpers, and other cross-cutting utilities not tied to a specific agent package.

## Responsibilities
- Keep scripts aligned with the guidance in `/AGENTS.md` and `/SSOT.md`.
- When behaviour changes, note it in PLANS.md or the task log so downstream agents stay informed.
- Ensure scripts remain idempotent and safe for local invocation; escalate breaking changes through PLANS.md.

## Points of Contact
- WorkFlowMAG / OperationsMAG coordination (see `/AGENTS.md` for primary owners).
