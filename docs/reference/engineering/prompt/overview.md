# Prompt Engineering Overview

## Purpose
- Provide a single entry point for vendor prompt engineering guidance so downstream agents can align automation, docs, and evaluation workflows.
- Highlight when to split deeper by provider and how to compare their recommendations.

## Contents
- [Anthropic / Claude prompt guidelines](Anthropic.md) — emphasises iterative prompt design, guardrails, and interactive tutorials.
- [Google prompt resources](Google.md) — combines Vertex AI prompt design docs with DeepMind research on reasoning techniques.
- [OpenAI prompt playbooks](OpenAI.md) — captures Codex-focused prompting strategies and cookbook patterns.

## Maintenance
- Revisit after major vendor documentation updates (typically each quarter or when models release).
- Keep `last synced` metadata current in this overview and the per-source files; note refreshes in each document’s Update Log.
