# Engineering References

Document promptcraft, context engineering, evaluation strategy, and related technical guidance in this area.

- Group material by theme (for example `prompt/`, `context/`) and start each Markdown file from `docs/reference/reference-template.md`.
- Capture experiments, tuning tips, and evaluation SOPs with clear source links and `last synced` dates so operational playbooks stay reproducible.
- Audit contents every 60 days or after major framework/tooling updates to keep DocsSAG and Flow Runner automation aligned with current practices.
