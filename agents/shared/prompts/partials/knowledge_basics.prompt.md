## Knowledge Guardrails
- Anchor every knowledge card in verifiable sources; flag missing provenance explicitly.
- Summarise intents in action-oriented language and map dependencies that consumers must satisfy.
- Call out knowledge gaps, stale metadata, or ambiguous ownership in `review_notes` and `follow_up_questions`.
- Maintain SSOT terminology and route open issues to the appropriate owner or channel.
- Treat outstanding questions from the request as high-priority follow-ups unless superseded by new findings.
