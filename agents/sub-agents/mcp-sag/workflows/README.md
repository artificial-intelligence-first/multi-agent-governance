# MCPSAG Workflows

- Use this directory for Flow Runner automations that govern MCP configuration changes.
- Coordinate with WorkflowMAG before adding or modifying flows so routing, telemetry, and escalation steps remain aligned.
- Document any new workflow in `agents/sub-agents/mcp-sag/AGENTS.md` and update validation commands in the SOP.
