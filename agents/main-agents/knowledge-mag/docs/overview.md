# KnowledgeMag Overview

KnowledgeMag serves as the knowledge custodian for the Multi Agent Governance. It consolidates briefs, policies, SOP updates, and reference links into a curated knowledge collection that downstream agents can trust. WorkFlowMAG supplies planning context, while KnowledgeMag ensures the information remains governed, discoverable, and actionable.

## Capabilities
- Groups related topics into “knowledge cards” with intents, dependencies, and next actions.
- Tracks provenance by indexing runbooks, SOPs, and external references with freshness metadata.
- Highlights data gaps, stale artefacts, and open questions that require human follow-through.
- Emits diagnostics under the `knowledge.*` namespace to monitor topic coverage and maintenance cadence.

## Handoffs
- **Inbound:** Requests conforming to `agents/contracts/knowledge_request.schema.json`, typically generated by planning agents, WorkFlowMAG, or human operators assembling knowledge packs.
- **Outbound:** Responses conforming to `agents/contracts/knowledge_response.schema.json`, containing knowledge cards, source indices, and reliability signals consumed by DocsSAG or operational teams.

## Routing
- Primary route key: `knowledge` (see `agents/AGENT_REGISTRY.yaml`).
- Backups may temporarily route to manual knowledge curation if SLAs degrade.

## Lifecycle
1. Validate incoming payloads against the knowledge request schema.
2. Load shared prompt guardrails and align terminology with `agents/SSOT.md`.
3. Generate knowledge cards, source indices, and curation signals.
4. Execute `workflows/curate_knowledge.wf.yaml` for schema validation and terminology checks.
5. Publish diagnostics, emit metrics, and notify dependent agents (e.g., DocsSAG) about outstanding gaps.
