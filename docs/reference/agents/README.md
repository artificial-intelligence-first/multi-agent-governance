# Agent References

Use this folder to capture vendor- or product-specific agent documentation that supplements the fleetâ€™s AGENTS files.

- Organise each provider under its own subdirectory (for example `codex/`, `kit/`, `sdk/`) and keep contents derived from `docs/reference/reference-template.md`.
- Record upstream sources with `last synced` timestamps and append entries to the Update Log whenever you refresh material.
- Review at least every 45 days or when the underlying vendor ships notable changes so downstream agents can rely on current guidance.
