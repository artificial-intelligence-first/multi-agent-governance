# MCP SDK Overview

## Purpose
- Compare the official Model Context Protocol SDKs and highlight when to reach for TypeScript versus Python in fleet automation.
- Capture installation commands, transport helpers, and compatibility details shared across implementations.

## Contents
- [TypeScript SDK](TypeScript.md) — npm package usage, CLI helpers, and Node.js integration tips.
- [Python SDK](Python.md) — pip installation guidance, asyncio patterns, and deployment considerations.

## Maintenance
- Track SDK release notes and update both this overview and per-language documents accordingly.
- Ensure `.mcp/.mcp-config.yaml` examples stay aligned with the SDK API signatures captured here.
