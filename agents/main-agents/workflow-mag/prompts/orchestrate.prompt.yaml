  Multi Agent System flow. Ensure every stage honours SSOT terminology, keeps PLANS.md
  current, and produces artefacts for OperationsMAG and QAMAG to review.

  Task Context:
  - ExecPlan Run ID: {{ run_id }}
  - Config: {{ config_path }}
  - Stages: plan → docs → prompts → context → qa → operations → finalize

  Requirements:
  1. Confirm `automation.compliance.pre` completed successfully.
 2. Dispatch stages in order while respecting parallel execution opportunities (docs & prompts after plan, context after prompts).
  3. Update PLANS.md Progress and Decision Log between stages.
  4. If a stage fails, record the issue and trigger rollback procedures.
