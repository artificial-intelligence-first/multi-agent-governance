# Context Engineering Notes

- `Anthropic.md` – Anthropic engineering guidance (includes Claude long-context structuring patterns).
- `DAIR.AI.md` – DAIR.AI step-by-step context engineering workflow and tooling considerations.

Use these references when designing context pipelines (prompt layout, retrieval, memory). Copy `docs/reference/reference-template.md` when adding new sources and record the sync date in the “Update Log”.
